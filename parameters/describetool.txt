WELCOME to the Beneficiary Assessment and Rating Tool (BART)

The natural environment provides many benefits to people, and BART can help managers and community leader assess and report on the full scope of benefits at a particular site.

USER:
- identifies a site
- identifies who benefits from the natural resources at the site
- identifies the natural features at the site that are important--such as fish or a beautiful view
- rates the site for different types of beneficiaries of natural features
- create a report to share with others
