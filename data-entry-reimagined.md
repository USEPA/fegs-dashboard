# Data Entry Reimagined
## Below are the steps in the reimagined data-entry.

1. The user is  shown a multiselect listbox that can be used to add beneficiaries, even duplicates to allow one beneficiary to  rate the site variously.
1. The chosen beneficiaries are populated into the data-entry-sheet as shown in the table above.
1. The user can add more beneficiaries at any time by using the  “Add Bens” button.
1. A button labeled “Add Attrs” is created at the end of each beneficiary’s row.
1. The user can add attributes for a rating in the same manner that beneficiaries were added by using the row’s button labeled “Add Attrs.”
1. Respective drop-downs are provided for <Rating> and <Infrastucture>.
1. A cell in each row has a button over it to load a userform where the user can explain each.
