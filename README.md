# fegs-dashboard
The fegs-dashboard provides a measure of goods and services by surveying users of the tool for qualitative data. An example of the data users are asked for is "How would you rate the water quantity in your region's rivers and streams?" One idea is to focus on using the tool to survey data at a site over time.

This data can then be used for data analysis. One example of possible analysis is finding correlations between foliage cover geodata and water abundance. For instance, when foliage in one region becomes less dense there may be water in a stream. The data prove useful to academics, administrators, and legislators.
