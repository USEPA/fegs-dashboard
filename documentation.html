<h2>The Whole Process' Synopsis</h2>
<p>The tool fegs-dashboard.xlsm gathers, records, and analyzes ratings of a site's natural features for various people. The rating process is described in detail below. The basic usage of this tool is to open fegs-dashboard.xlsm and be users through the workflow, downward from the top of the worksheet named dash.</p>
<h2>Structure of Entered Data</h2>
<p>Ratings are stored in data structured to give each record the rating of a single attribute for a single beneficiary. For example, say a rating of poor is submitted for boaters listing several natural features. Upon submission, the tool creates an individual record for each natural feature listed in this rating. The form of a record is shown in a table below.</p>

		<td>Field 6</td>
		<td>Field 7</td>
